# Algorithms  

A personal repository for practicing and sharing my learnings about **data structures and algorithms**.  

---

## Background  
I studied this content during my **Software Engineering** degree, but recently decided to revisit my notes and organize everything in one place.  
This journey started while reading *"Grokking Algorithms"* by **Aditya Y. Bhargava**.  

---

## Whatâ€™s Inside  
All code is written in **Python**, with the goal of both improving my Python skills and deepening my understanding of algorithms.  

Topics covered include:  
- ðŸ“‚ **Data Structures**  
- ðŸ”„ **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**  
- ðŸ§© **LeetCode Problems & Practice**  

---

## Purpose  
- Consolidate my knowledge in one repository  
- Keep track of progress while practicing  
- Share useful implementations for others learning algorithms  

---

## Structure
I'll keep improving the structure as I add new algorithms.
